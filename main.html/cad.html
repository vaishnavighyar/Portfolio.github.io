            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;">Computer Aided Design (CAD) {drafting app AutoCad} has been available since 1982 as desktop app,
               and from 2010 as mobile app marketed as AutoCad 360.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;"> Here from my 2nd module conducted on second week ,we were introduced to two new softwares that were
                Fusion 360 and AutoCad 2023 .Both are designing tools but the main difference between them is
                Fusion 360 is use for 3D modeling and manufacturing cloud software whereas AutoCad is a 2D drafting software 
                that can be used to draw 3D objects manually.</p>   
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;">After  getting familiar with all the tools of software , we were assign the task to apply our learnings
               and design a product through each software while taking help of online sources. </p>  
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;">First product that I Designed using Fusion 360 was a  bracelet, which I have attached on left side.While designing
               the bracelet i had to go step-by-step by first plouting out the structure accurately using extrude,
                off-plane,coil,merge ,etc properties. After that I added sliver colour to give appealing visual effect. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;">Second product that i design was using AutoCad 2023.Here I converted a 2D machine part to 3D using the various
               tools available in autocad libraries. </p>
